# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

As citizens of our communities, our country, and the world, we want our decisions to be well informed and well-reasoned. Whenever humans make decisions about things they value, there are conflicts and trade-offs. The field of ethics, the study of moral philosophy, has a long history of looking at how to identify and resolve such conflicts. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

1. Students will use ethical reasoning to evaluate social issues related to computing.
2. Students will discuss trade-offs between the rights of personal privacy and governments' concerns with safety and security.
3. Students will describe cyberbullying and why legal remedies are so difficult to apply.
4. Students will discuss how social media makes it easier to globally disseminate rumors and false information that can have a profound effect on governments worldwide.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

Students will take the following written assessment:

Directions: For the following, answer the question completely and to the best of your ability. Use complete sentences when necessary.

1) Some people believe that the content of the Internet should be regulated. Consider the following two analogies:
•	Radio and TV stations are regulated with rules regarding obscenity and the amount of advertising allowed, therefore, the Internet should be as well.
•	Private phone conversations are not regulated, therefore, the Internet should not be as well.
Which analogy is more appropriate? Justify your position.


2) There are times when you want someone to break into your house. For example, it you house is on fire, you probably wouldn't object is firefighters use an ax on the front door. Try to make an argument based on this analogy that supports ethical hacking.


3) Should cyberbullying be made illegal, or should it be something handled (more informally) by parents, teachers, and th social networking companies? Justify your position.


### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
