# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

AP Computer Science Principles, 10-12th grade
Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing

As citizens of our communities, our country, and the world, we want our decisions to be well informed and well-reasoned. Whenever humans make decisions about things they value, there are conflicts and trade-offs. The field of ethics, the study of moral philosophy, has a long history of looking at how to identify and resolve such conflicts. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

1. Students will use ethical reasoning to evaluate social issues related to computing.
2. Students will discuss trade-offs between the rights of personal privacy and governments' concerns with safety and security.
3. Students will describe cyberbullying and why legal remedies are so difficult to apply.
4. Students will discuss how social media makes it easier to globally disseminate rumors and false information that can have a profound effect on governments worldwide.

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

Students are provided 4 case studies from which they must choose one to read, evaluate, and answer the provided discussion questions.

Options for sharing can include oral presentations (with slides), written responses, group share outs, think pair share, etc.

Case Study 1: 

Is It Sharing or Stealing?
Source: Schneider, G. M., & Gersting, J. L. (2019). Invitation to computer science. Cengage Learning.

In your time online, I am sure you have come across many advertisements and warnings stating the negative consequences of copying or sharing copyrighted material, such as music, videos, photographs, video games, and the like. This "sharing" of music and movies was commonplace before the Internet, but it was mostly done on a personal level (friend to friend). Although this was technically illegal, the recording and movie industries focused their attention on "true" piracy, which involves the mass production of bootleg products for sale.

In the spring of 1999, two Northeastern University students, Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, created a system intended to simplify the sharing of computer files with strangers. They called their system "Napster" and it because a wonderful example of how technical achievements in computing can have significant social effects. The Napster software set up what is called a peer-to-peer file sharing. On a simple level, Napster "introduced" two people who had files to share, the file sharing actually took place between the people, not through Napster. This meant that although thousands and thousands of bootleg copies were being made, Napster itself wasn't making or distributing them. It was not clear if what Napster was doing was even illegal, let along unethical.

There was a suit filed against Napster, and recording companies insisted that Napster was a conspiracy to encourage mass infringement of US copyright law. Napster's supporters argued that the system was merely acting as a search engine, providing information on songs and their location, but not participating in the actual exchange of copyrighted information.


This case leads to many ethical questions, but two are worth special attention and discussion:

1. Is it right to swap copyrighted music or book files, download and watch copyrighted videos, or use copyrighted photos without permission?

2. Is it right to provide a search engine whose only purpose is to allow users to search each other's databases of copyrighted music and book files, videos, and photos?



Case Study 2: Legal Snooping – Privacy vs Security
Source: Schneider, G. M., & Gersting, J. L. (2019). Invitation to computer science. Cengage Learning.

In the summer of 2013, the exploits of American Computer professional and former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden came to light when he leaked classified information from the NSA to the international news media. Snowden disclosed thousands of classified documents that revealed the extend of the NSA's global surveillance programs, including monitoring of US phone and email traffic and the phone conversations of over 25 world leaders. To some, Snowden was a hero, a "whistleblower" who showed how concerns for national security could be used to trample basic constitutional rights and invade personal privacy. To others, he was a traitor. The US Department of Justice charged him with violating the Espionage Act, which he had to stand trial for when he returns to the US. Currently, he lives in an undisclosed location in Russia.

This cases raises two ethical questions:

1. Is there a proper balance that can be created between national security and personal privacy?

2. If the government was surveillancing civilians, should they be secretive about it or more transparent about what information they are gathering and storing?



Case Study 3: Ashely Madison Hack
Source: https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ashley-madison-hack-included-data-dump/story?id=33176238

It's a bad day for millions of cheaters. Personal data believed to have been stolen from the adultery website Ashley Madison has been posted on the dark Web, apparently exposing names, email addresses and phone numbers for some of the website's 37 million members, among other information. The website connects people looking to have an extramarital affair.

The database of private information was posted to the dark Web, a corner of the Internet difficult to reach without some Web savvy. The bottom line: While personal information has been breached, it would take skill for someone to find a specific person to confirm his or her interest in cheating. It's also important to note that Ashley Madison users aren't required to verify their email addresses, meaning some found in the dump may have been hijacked by Ashley Madison users seeking to keep their own email addresses off their accounts.

Going by the name "The Impact Team," the hacker or hackers said the breach was spurred by a disagreement with Avid Life Media's business practices, specifically a "full delete" feature. For $19, the company allows repentant cheaters to scrub their information from the website.
"Full Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It’s also a complete lie," the Impact Team wrote after the hack last month. "Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is of course the most important information the users want removed."

Business practices aside, the hacker or hackers also had another message: "Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion...Too bad for ALM, you promised secrecy but didn't deliver."

A statement posted on Avid Life Media's website said "this event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality. It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any freethinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities. The criminal, or criminals, involved in this act have appointed themselves as the moral judge, juror, and executioner, seeing fit to impose a personal notion of virtue on all of society. We will not sit idly by and allow these thieves to force their personal ideology on citizens around the world. We are continuing to fully cooperate with law enforcement to seek to hold the guilty parties accountable to the strictest measures of the law," the statement said.

This raises an interesting ethical question around hacking:

If the hacking was done in the name of a good cause, does it make it okay?


Case Study 4: Cyberbullying
Source: Schneider, G. M., & Gersting, J. L. (2019). Invitation to computer science. Cengage Learning.

Bullying is a problem that has been around for a long time, however the growth of the Internet an social media has allowed bullying and the violation of one's personal privacy to become much easier; online taunting allows bullies to remain anonymous, gang up on victims in enormous numbers, harass victims in place that would normally be safe (such as within their own home), and have their hateful speeches live on in cyberspace long after they have moved on.

Cyberbullying is humiliating, taunting, threatening, or invading someone's privacy using the Internet, web, or other type of electronic technology. Cyberbullying can take many forms, from posting hurtful and insulting messages, to leaking sensitive and embarrassing personal data, to online threats of violence and physical assault.

As in most high-text fields, the enactment of state and federal statutes to deal with cyberbullying lags far behind. Although 34 states have enacted laws against cyberbullying, these laws often apply only to minors and only to behaviors committed at school or on public property. Laws dealing with private communications between adults or wider audiences have been challenged and struck down in court for violating First Amendment rights of free speech, even speech that might be considered hurtful or embarrassing.

Discussion Questions:

1. Is cyberbullying a crime or does it fall under first amendment rights?

2. Why do people engage in cyberbullying?



### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

Students will take the following written assessment:

Directions: For the following, answer one of the questions completely and to the best of your ability. Use complete sentences when necessary.

1) Some people believe that the content of the Internet should be regulated. Consider the following two analogies:
•	Radio and TV stations are regulated with rules regarding obscenity and the amount of advertising allowed, therefore, the Internet should be as well.
•	Private phone conversations are not regulated, therefore, the Internet should not be as well.
Which analogy is more appropriate? Justify your position.


2) There are times when you want someone to break into your house. For example, it you house is on fire, you probably wouldn't object is firefighters use an ax on the front door. Try to make an argument based on this analogy that supports ethical hacking.


3) Should cyberbullying be made illegal, or should it be something handled (more informally) by parents, teachers, and th social networking companies? Justify your position.


### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
